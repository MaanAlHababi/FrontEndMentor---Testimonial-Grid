- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://your-live-site-url.com)

## My process

1. Build the skeleton of the webpage using semantic HTML.
2. Tidy the styling by aligning the content.
3. Add a splash of color. Add all the colors, and apply text formatting.
4. Align and order the content using CSS grid.
5. Make sure the content is correctly aligned and ordered in different device sizes and also added the media query.
6. Add the miscellanious features, in this case the quotation mark pattern in one of the testimonial cards.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

1. Ordering items in grids. It seems simple enough but I feel like there is a bit more I need to know about.
2. Z-indexing doesn't work as intended.
